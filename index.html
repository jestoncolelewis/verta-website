        <h2>Founder's Note</h2>
        <p><br>VERTA Safety (Vehicle Emergency Response Tactical Alert) is a system that alerts vehicles and pedestrians when an ambulance, fire truck, police car or other emergency vehicle is approaching “Code”3 – responding to a call with lights & sirens.Created by First Responders – for First Responders and civilians, our mission is to create a safer environment for vehicles and pedestrians by ensuring safe passage for emergency vehicles via our alert system.</br><br>As roadways become more congested and drivers more distracted, VERTASafety app aims to give drivers added crucial time to look for a safe place to pull over to allow an Emergency Vehicle to pass. VERTASafety app allows responding Emergency Vehicles to track other First Responder vehicles in the area who are rolling Code 3 so they can proceed safely through intersections and potential collision areas.</br><br>A recent survey by emergency service drivers revealed that over half of First Responders responses are delayed by drivers not pulling over, colliding with or impeding in some way Emergency Vehicles. The survey revealed that traffic light intersections were the highest risk location with 42 percent revealing drivers were often confused on how to react to emergency vehicles in these areas. Our goal is to create a dependable and effective alert system that reduces accidents and saves lives by allowing emergency vehicles to maneuver safely through traffic.</br></p>
